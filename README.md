# MetaBalls2DShading
Metaballs shading in 2D w/ physics

![Alt Text](/metaballs.gif)

This project was built using [Unity (game engine)](https://unity3d.com/), [Cg shader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cg_(programming_language)) and [metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs). Support physics which was written from scratch: gravity, friction forces. For fun stuff I added also 4 properties for metaballs: mass absorbing/desorbing rate, radius compression/expansion rate. Enjoy!

### How to play
- Use `+/- numpad` to add/remove metaball
- Use `Inspector` to control metaball's properties
- Use `shader` to manipulate pixel color

*In case if you don't have numpad from your keyboard pls refer to the InputHandler function*
